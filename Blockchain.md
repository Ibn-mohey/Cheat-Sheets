## What Money is

- It is a key lesson of finance upon which much of society is built that the **value of money** is a **social construct** of trust.
- Value is subjective, and value is referring to both material value - which is the value that we associated to goods and services- but also the value that we place on morality and personal connections.
- Concept of money is largely a social construct, that was invented as a medium of exchange to prescribe a specific value

## What fiat money is

- A government-issued currency that is not backed by physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

## The purpose of banks

- Financial system and finance refers to the services related to the management of money. And these requires a deep trust that is called "Fiduciary Relationship".
- Banks serve 4 primary aspects:
  - They save money safely
  - Financing, consumer credit and capital.
  - Facilitate investment.
  - Financial advice.

## Five Key Ethics Principles

1. Trust "Fiduciary Relationship"
2. Proximity:
   - In psychology, the concept of “proximity” is a key variable in explaining behavior in many circumstances.
   - Proximity denotes both how physically close or emotionally close we are to someone or something. And differences in proximity can lead to varied outcomes.
3. Accountability:
   - Accountability is really a subset of governance and regulation, and is essentially a question about fairness and who is responsible when things go wrong.
4. Cultural lag:
   - It is the idea that it takes time for culture to catch up with technological innovations, and that social problems and conflicts are caused by this lag.
   - Cultural lag considers the best way to ethically introduce new technologies into the marketplace.
   - Technological innovations are often characterized by one word: **Disruption**.
   - Technology is able to change more quickly than society can culturally adapt to such innovations.
   - Sociologists and economists believe that many of society’s most challenging problems are often caused by cultural lag.
   - The reality is that some of the biggest problems society faces – things that are so big that we sometimes have trouble seeing or understanding them – are often tied to technological disruption and the cultural lag that stems from them.
5. Privacy

## What blockchain is

- The term can be used to refer different meanings or things. It is used to refer Bitcoin Blockchain, Ethereum Blockchain or other digital tokens (Smart Contracts). But most of time it is referred for the Distributed Ledger.  
  **Distributed Ledger** is a list of transactions that distributed across a number of computers that acts as the ultimate books and records (rather than being stored on central server).

- Essentially a series of digital records, referred to as blocks, which are connected together forming a chain of records, hence _Block chain_ and secured using cryptography.

- Instead of this data being kept in a single place though, the information is replicated and distributed across a peer to peer network of computers.
  The network collaborates together to confirm if new blocks of data can be added to the chain, which makes it difficult for a single member of the network to add incorrect information.

- This decentralized nature also makes the blockchain difficult to modify thus preventing tampering.

- It is developed to solve the issue of trust between parties.

- A blockchain is a relatively new kind of database that has become the trendy solution for storing digital information more securely.

- It is the technology that supports crypto currencies like Bitcoin.

- Blockchain technology is much like a bag of technologies, much like Lego. From this bag you can take out different pieces and combine them together in a variety of ways to create different results.

- The concept of the blockchain and its offshoot - cryptocurrencies, really entered into the public domain after a white paper was published in 2008
  by Satoshi Nakomoto, titled: Bitcoin: [A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System.](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

- There are two main types of Blockchain, Public and Private that relates to the blockchain architecture based on ownership of the data infrastructure. Permissionless and permissioned relates to architecture based on read and write permissions granted to the participants.
  1. Public blockchain holds a list of transactions that can be written with anyone with no gatekeeper to approve or reject parties who want the right in transactions. And it is the most open form of blockchain where anyone can join, read and write and data is hosted publicly. This is where most cryptocurrency projects focus on.
  2. Private blockchain, has a controlling party who allows participants to read and write transactions. This is where most enterprise blockchain established by corporates, focus on.

## Key points

### The necessity of Blockchain technology

It is faster, cheaper, smarter always better when it comes data.

### Smart Contracts

- The current form of smart contracts are neither smart nor even contracts.
- A smart contract is simply a computer protocol, some lines of code that automatically execute a specified action, like releasing a payment, when certain conditions are fulfilled. So this code might represent an aspect of a contract, but the code itself is not actually a contract.  
  _ex: In online bazaars (OLX), smart contracts guarantees that the payment will be sent automatically once the package delivery is confirmed._
- The benefits of Smart Contracts:
  - No Human Error:  
    These things don't require human interpretation, hence taking out some human error.
  - Immutable:  
    Once a smart contract is coded in, generally it can't be changed.
  - Remove Third Party:  
    Lots of transactions historically, a third party has been necessary to hold payment or collateral due to risk related to a lack of trust. This type of third party is something known as an escrow agent.
- Because of those factors, this ultimately should save time and money, thus making things more efficient and reducing transactional friction.

### Tokenization

- The representation of real or virtual assets on a blockchain — is spreading to raw materials, finished goods, income-producing securities, membership rights and more. You can now represent on a blockchain almost everything businesses do.

### Initial coin offerings (ICOs)

- A company sells a predefined number of digital tokens to the public, are funnelling billions of dollars into blockchain platforms. Increasingly an alternative to classic debt/capital funding as provided today by venture capital and private equity firms and banks, ICOs in the first five months of 2018 raised \$13.7 billion. The largest ICOs to date have been diverse and included EOS, which is focused on blockchain infrastructure; Huobi Token, a coin for a South Korean crypto exchange; and Hdac, an Internet of Things platform.

### The unintended consequences that will arise from introducing artificial intelligence into everyday life

- They can scale faster than ever and quickly engulf the entire world.
- While they may have the power to unite and transform, they can also be used to bind and control.

## Bitcoin vs Blockchain

- Bitcoin is an application of blockchain. Bitcoin is a digital asset than can be bought or send to someone, can be considered as the currency of the internet. This transaction happens on a peer to peer basis without the involve of a central 3rd party. Adding to this, the transaction is recognized in seconds and may settle within hours.
- Blockchain is a technology that enables the moving of theses assets from one individual to another one.

## How blockchain works

- The traditional transaction is Person A wants to transfer $100 dollars to Person B. Person A orders a third party which is the bank to transfer the money to Person B. The third party verifies whether Person A has sufficient funds, identifies Person's B bank and moves the money minus the fees. This process takes an average of 3 days.
- Blockchain eliminates three elements from the transaction. Firstly, no third party is needed and people can interact with each other directly on peer to peer basis. Secondly, there would be a shorter waiting period with a faster transfer. And thirdly the fees are relatively lower compared to what the third party would collect to facilitate the transaction.

### Theoretically

#### How Blockchain addresses this in the payment transfer scenario

1. Open Ledger: chain of transactions are open and public to everyone on the network so everyone in the network can see where the money is, how much money each person holds and therefore can determine whether the transaction is valid or not.
2. Distributed Ledger: It is a centralized ledger where a chain of transactions are recorded. However, the power of blockchain is we can remove the centralized party and distribute across the participants in the network (called loads). In such that everyone can hold the same ledger in their respective nodes and anyone else who joins the network can hold a copy of the ledger and hold the chain of the transactions. This removes the needs of having a trusted centralized party to hold the ledger. But this leads to a problem in which, all participants needs to see the same version of the ledger.
3. Mining: Any transaction occurs, needs to be published to the network but at this stage the transaction is invalid data and will not be recorded in the ledger. In order for the transactions to be validated and recorded into the ledger, miners will need to be involved. Miners are special nodes who compete amongst themselves to take invalid data transaction and validate it and then put it onto the ledger. The first miner who does that gets a financial reward which in our context is bitcoin. In order to be the first to win, a miner needs to validate the new transaction which is relatively easy as the ledger is open and can be immediately calculated. After that, miners need to find a key which enables miners to lock the new transaction into the previous transaction in the chain. In order to find the key, miners needs to invest computational power and time because the search is random and miners need to keep guessing until the first get the key. This incentive reward makes ensures that collectively the network can agree on the official ledger that should be used by everyone.

#### What the benefit of Decentralization is

- Allows participants to trust a counter party without knowing them.
- Trust is based on distributed ledger maintained different parties.
- No one party can manipulate the ledger.

### Technically

#### Cryptography

- Blocks are [cryptographically](/cryptography.md) linked together in which each block should have four fields.
  1. Block number: which identifies the number of the block in the chain.
  2. Nonce: stands for number used only once. It gives extra control and flexibility. It is mainly used in mining.
  3. Data: Can hold several transactions in one block
  4. Previous Hash: that references the previous block.
- The Hash of the block (64 character long) is calculated using all these using a hashing algorithm.
- The hash is like a fingerprint which is a unique identification to the block and the hash is calculated according to
- The first ever block which is called GENESIS BLOCK has a previous hash value of zeros.
- Any change or tamper to the block's data will change the Hash value and will get noticed.

#### Immutable Ledger

- Due to the Cryptography Link behavior, the ledger can't be changed because each block depends on the previous and affects the next one. So, any change in one block will affect all succeeding blocks.

#### Distributed P2P Network

- If one block is forged or changed then all succeeding blocks must be changed accordingly or otherwise the chain will be broken.
- This problem can be solved by the distributed peer to peer network.
- All computers in the network are interconnected (not everybody connected to everybody), but the more they are connected to the better. Each computer will have a copy of this ledger of transactions.
- These copies will not have any names, only keys for identification.
- The only way to hack this system is to hack more than 50% of all computers in the network and alter the block and all its succeeding blocks and in minutes, which is practically impossible.
- [An article by Vitalik Buterin, creator of Etherum, explains the difference between decentralization and distributed](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)

#### Mining

- At first, there is a Target Hash number that the block Hash number must be below the Target Hash.
- And all block fields can not be changed except for the Nonce field.
- The miners try to figure out the nonce value that would result in a Hash number that is below that Target Hash number.
- Once a winning hash is found, the nonce used is called the Golden Nonce.

#### Consensus Protocol

- There are multiple different types for Consensus Protocol, but the most famous two are Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
- An example for PoW is BitCoin in which mining costs electricity and many for the rigs to find the Golden Nonce and in result they will be granted BitCoins as a reward. Finding this Golden Nonce is proof of work.
- A Consensus protocol has a set of rules or checks that the system checks when a new block is added to the network. These rules will make sure that the added block is not added maliciously.
- Cryptographic puzzles are hard to solve but easy to verify. As the miners are trying to find the Golden Nonce which requires a lot of time to be found while once found it can be easily verified by calculating the Hash number.
- A Consensus protocol solves another problem is that when two new blocks are created at the same time. This will cause a conflict to the system because one of them only has to be placed first. This conflict is solved by (Byzantine Fault tolerance), in which the block that has higher hashing power will placed first. The hashing power is calculated by how fast the computer can check the set of rules. And the block that its computers have a higher hashing power in total with more than 50% percent of all of the network, will be accepted first. Then, the system will wait for another block to be added to the system of the same computer that holds that first Block. And accordingly, all computers in the network will only accept these new two blocks and ignore that conflicted other block.
- This leftover block is called Orphaned Block and it will not be valid anymore and the miners will lose their reward because of that.

## Forms of blockchain

### 1. Public Chains

- They are truly decentralized and distributed blockchains.
- Participants are often anonymous and each can write, read and verify transaction.
- Every participants has a complete ledger and may review transactions.
- The security of public chains is guaranteed by consensus mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake.
- Deployment of application is relatively easy which allows global access.
- With larger volumes of data, there are operational issues to consider. Longer Time and Higher maintenance cost.

### 2. Private Chains

- They are featured with distributed ledgers without decentralization.
- Controller of the network determines who is eligible to participate and to confirm transactions.
- Members within a private chain are not rewarded with virtual currencies.
- Examples of where private chains provide great value include:
  - Auditing tests within a company or the government
  - In transactions and settlement between banks within a consortium.

### 3. Consortium chains

- They are blockchains with characteristics between public and private chains.
- They are initiated by institutions and practice form of decentralization. Participants are predetermined based on certain criteria and the nodes to confirm a transaction are assigned in advance.
- They allow easy permission control setting.
- They, as an intermediate form of blockchain, reduce the cost of an individual's participation as a node and facilitate the establishment of the system.
- It has been one of the key focus of major financial institutions and technology companies.

| Public Chains                                                     | Private Chains and Consortium Chains                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not suitable for exchanges                                        | More suitable for exchanges                                                         |
| Non conductive to financial transactions which require anonymity. | They employ proprietary networks and have greater control over participants.        |
| Huge data transfer leads to high power and storage requirements.  | They are more applicable and extensible in financial business.                      |
| Time lag in transaction recording.                                | Transactions costs are kept at lower level and regulators prefer the non-anonymity. |

## Key features of blockchain

- Block chain is distributed and decentralized encrypted data stored in a distributed manner. Each node stores a complete set of the general ledger and can view all transaction data.
- It is encrypted and tamper proof with cryptography and timestamp each proceeds strictly in chronological order. Such irreversibility in time ensures that any attempt to tamper with block chain data will be easily traceable. The consensus mechanism safe guards the data codes and verifies their authenticity even if there are error or tampering with an individual node. The authenticity of the entire block chain ledger can guaranteed given that the majority of nodes carry same information. This features resolves the traditional model reliance on the trustworthiness of intermediaries and prevents fake transactions.
- It is extensible and programmable. It is an open source bottom level technology based on various kinds of extension decentralization antitrust can be achieved. New entities can be easily added to a blockchain in a form of a node without affecting existing nodes. Preconditions of a transaction can be set through code programming so that the transaction will be blocked automatically if it doesn't meet the preconditions. Programmable codes of blockchain as known as smart contracts can satisfy the complex demands in the financial market in a traditional model. In traditional model control mechanisms often cannot detect address risks in a timely manner. Smart contracts in the other hand can ensure early risk detection and risk control.

## Cashless

- Using cashless payments, it's just faster and more efficient, leads better service. So basically, using a mobile payment system, help her business be more efficient and hopefully more profitable.

## Potential Use Cases for Blockchain Technology

- Streamlined supply chains:  
  Blockchain is perfectly suited to the task at hand, with real-time tracking that’s especially appealing to companies with multiple supply chains. Major multinational retailer Walmart has partnered with IBM to work on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, for example, to track food staples from supplier to shelf. Proper implementation of the ledger could also prove valuable for pharmaceutical giants, which are required by law to maintain the chain of custody over every pill.

- Forming smarter predictions:  
  Because all transaction data is stored directly to the ledger, blockchain-based business intelligence and analytics tools are more capable than ever of scraping massive amounts of data and uncovering hidden insights. Some have already started applying the concept for practical needs. The ecosystem is designed to deliver accurate forecasts, putting predictive capabilities in the hands of consumers and smaller private enterprises.

- Building decentralized apps:  
  One of the biggest changes blockchain offers developers is the ability to build decentralized applications (or dApps) that circumvent many problems they have today. Originally created using the Ethereum ERC-20 chain, dApps offer a truly decentralized platform that inherits many of the benefits blockchain provides, including greater democratization, peer-to-peer interactions, and a fully trustless protocol based on consensus. The biggest difference, however, is the way data is stored and accessed. Unlike traditional apps where data is centralized in one location, dApps store transaction and other data directly on blockchain’s distributed ledger, which removes single points of failure and makes for more transparent operation.

- Simplifying the Internet of Things:  
  The Internet of Things represents one of the major pillars of greater automation efforts. Connected ecosystems that can record, process, and share interactions are instrumental in building smarter cities and supporting the coming autonomous vehicle revolution. Blockchain means that the infrastructure has finally caught up with modern IoT capabilities.  
  Distributed ledger technology can record the immense amounts of data produced by IoT systems in a trustless fashion and transparently analyze data points to produce valuable insights. Thanks to its identification, verification, and data transfer abilities, blockchain is perfectly suited for hosting IoT devices for both public and private sector use cases.

- Fortifying identity management:  
  Using blockchain for identity verification gives a new dimension to security, removing verification bottlenecks and providing more accurate results. For instance, Civic’s Secure Identity Platform (SIP) is designed for multi-factor authentication without the need for passwords or usernames and relies instead on biometric information verified by the blockchain ledger.  
  Each user goes through an identity check, creating a verifiable user ID that has been validated. From there, partnering organizations like banks or governments can review a user’s personal identifying information in an encrypted format.

## Blockchain Frameworks

It’s helpful to use frameworks to consider risk and implications. One such framework that was found to be meaningful is ["The Blockchain Ethical Design Framework"](http://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/The-Blockchain-Ethical-Design-Framework.pdf%20). This Framework was written by Cara LaPointe and Lara Fishbane.  
The framework they use is focused around six guiding questions when using blockchain as a solution:

- How is governance created and maintained?
- How is identity defined and established?
- How are inputs verified and transactions authenticated?
- How is access defined, granted, and executed?
- How is ownership of data defined, granted, and executed?
- And finally, how is security set-up and ensured?

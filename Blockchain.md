# Blockchain

## What blockchain is

* The term can be used to refer different meanings or things. It is used to refer Bitcoin Blockchain, Ethereum Blockchain or other digital tokens (Smart Contracts). But most of time it is referred for the Distributed Ledger.  
**Distributed Ledger** is a list of transactions that distributed across a number of computers that acts as the ultimate books and records (rather than being stored on central server).

* It is developed to solve the issue of trust between parties.

* It is the technology that supports crypto currencies like Bitcoin.

* Blockchain technology is much like a bag of technologies, much like Lego. From this bag you can take out different pieces and combine them together in a variety of ways to create different results.

* There are two main types of Blockchain, Public and Private that relates to the blockchain architecture based on ownership of the data infrastructure. Permissionless and permissioned relates to architecture based on read and write permissions granted to the participants.
  1. Public blockchain holds a list of transactions that can be written with anyone with no gatekeeper to approve or reject parties who want the right in transactions. And it is the most open form of blockchain where anyone can join, read and write and data is hosted publicly. This is where most cryptocurrency projects focus on.
  2. Private blockchain, has a controlling party who allows participants to read and write transactions. This is where most enterprise blockchain established by corporates, focus on.

## Bitcoin vs Blockchain

* Bitcoin is an application of blockchain. Bitcoin is a digital asset than can be bought or send to someone, can be considered as the currency of the internet. This transaction happens on a peer to peer basis without the involve of a central 3rd party. Adding to this, the transaction is recognized in seconds and may settle within hours.
* Blockchain is a technology that enables the moving of theses assets from one individual to another one.

## How blockchain works

* The traditional transaction is Person A wants to transfer $100 dollars to Person B. Person A orders a third party which is the bank to transfer the money to Person B. The third party verifies whether Person A has sufficient funds, identifies Person's B bank and moves the money minus the fees. This process takes an average of 3 days.
* Blockchain eliminates three elements from the transaction. Firstly, no third party is needed and people can interact with each other directly on peer to peer basis. Secondly, there would be a shorter waiting period with a faster transfer. And thirdly the fees are relatively lower compared to what the third party would collect to facilitate the transaction.

### How Blockchain addresses this in the payment transfer scenario

1. Open Ledger: chain of transactions are open and public to everyone on the network so everyone in the network can see where the money is, how much money each person holds and therefore can determine whether the transaction is valid not.
2. Distributed Ledger: It is a centralized ledger where a chain of transactions are recorded. However, the power of blockchain is we can remove the centralized party and distribute across the participants in the network (called loads). In such that everyone can hold the same ledger in their respective nodes and anyone else who joins the network can hold a copy of the ledger and hold the chain of the transactions. This removes the needs of having a trusted centralized party to hold the ledger. But this leads to a problem in which, all participants needs to see the same version of the ledger.
3. Mining: Any transaction occurs, needs to be published to the network but at this stage the transaction is invalid data and will not be recorded in the ledger. In order for the transactions to be validated and recorded into the ledger, miners will need to be involved. Miners are special nodes who compete amongst themselves to take invalid data transaction and validate it and then put it onto the ledger. The first miner who does that gets a financial reward which in our context is bitcoin. In order to be the first to win, a miner needs to validate the new transaction which is relatively easy as the ledger is open and can be immediately calculated. After that, miners need to find a key which enables miners to lock the new transaction into the previous transaction in the chain. In order to find the key, miners needs to invest computational power and time because the search is random and miners need to keep guessing until the first get the key. This incentive reward makes ensures that collectively the network can agree on the official ledger that should be used by everyone.

### What the benefit of decentralization is

* Allows participants to trust a counterparty without knowing them.
* Trust is based on distributed ledger maintained different parties.
* No one party can manipulate the ledger.

## Forms of blockchain

### 1. Public Chains

* They are truly decentralized and distributed blockchains.
* Participants are often anonymous and each can write, read and verify transaction.
* Every participants has a complete ledger and may review transactions.
* The security of public chains is guaranteed by consensus mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake.
* Deployment of application is relatively easy which allows global access.
* With larger volumes of data, there are operational issues to consider. Longer Time and Higher maintenance cost.

### 2. Private Chains

* They are featured with distributed ledgers without decentralization.
* Controller of the network determines who is eligible to participate and to confirm transactions.
* Members within a private chain are not rewarded with virtual currencies.
* Examples of where private chains provide great value include:
  * Auditing tests within a company or the government
  * In transactions and settlement between banks within a consortium.

### 3. Consortium chains

* They are blockchains with characteristics between public and private chains.
* They are initiated by institutions and practice form of decentralization. Participants are predetermined based on certain criteria and the nodes to confirm a transaction are assigned in advance.
* They allow easy permission control setting.
* They, as an intermediate form of blockchain, reduce the cost of an individual's participation as a node and facilitate the establishment of the system.
* It has been one of the key focus of major financial institutions and technology companies.

Public Chains | Private Chains | Consortium Chains
---|---|---
|Not suitable for exchanges | More suitable for exchanges ||
| Non conductive to financial transactions which require anonymity. <br> Huge data transfer leads to high power and storage requirements. <br> Time lag in transaction recording. | Private and consortium chains employ proprietary networks and have greater control over participants. <br> They are more applicable and extensible in financial business. <br> Transactions costs are kept at lower level. <br> regulators prefer the non-anonymity. ||

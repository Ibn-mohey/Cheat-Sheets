## What RFID is

RFID  (Radio Frequency Identification)  is technology which works on radio frequency and it is used for the auto-identification for the different object.
In this RFID system, this RFID reader continuously sends radio waves of a particular frequency. If the object, on which this RFID tag is attached is within the range of this radio waves then it sends the feedback back to this RFID reader. And based on this feedback, RFID reader identifies the object.

## The RFID system mainly consists of two parts

It is similar to barcode technology but barcode technology needs the reader and barcode to be in line of sight. While RFID technology, as long as the object is in the range of the reader, the the object can sends its feedback signal to the reader.

### 1. RFID Reader or Interrogator

It continuously sends radio waves. So whenever the RFID tag is range, then this tag will transmit back feedback signal to the reader.

It comes in many sizes and shapes. It could be handheld devices or buzzers at the exit doors.

It consists of three components.

1. RF signal generator that generates radio waves to be received by the RFID tags and responds with its feedback signal.
2. Receiver or signal detector that process the information which received from RFID tag.

### 2. RFID Tags

Now, three different kinds of RFID tags are commercially available.

1. Passive tags:  
   These passive tags do not have any power supply. They used to get their power from the incoming radio waves from the Readers.
   It comes in different shapes, key chains, label or stickers.
2. Active tags:  
   Active tags have a power source for their internal circuities. And for sending the response to the reader also, it uses its own power supply.
3. Semi-passive tags:  
   In the case of semi-passive tags, they have a power supply for internal circuities, but for sending the response it relies on the radio waves received from the Reader.

#### Operating Frequency

This RFID system is mainly operated in three frequency bands. The exact frequency of operation varies from country to country.

1. LF: Low-Frequency band 125 KHz or 134 KHz and ranges up to 10 cm.
2. HF: High-Frequency band 13.56 MHz and ranges up to 1 m.
3. UHF: Ultra  High-Frequency band 860-960 MHz and ranges up to 10-15 m.

Operating Principles:

Most of the RFID systems operate on any of this two principles.

1. Load Modulation (LF and HF)
2. Backscattered Modulations (UHF)

Applications of RFID:

1. Institutions: Library, Hospitals, Schools, and Colleges
2. Transportation and Logistics
3. Access Control
4. Sports
5. Animal Tracking

## RFID vs NFC

RFID is the process by which items are uniquely identified using radio waves, and NFC is a specialized subset within the family of RFID technology. Specifically, NFC is a branch of High-Frequency (HF) RFID, and both operate at the 13.56 MHz frequency. NFC is designed to be a secure form of data exchange, and an NFC device is capable of being both an NFC reader and an NFC tag. This unique feature allows NFC devices to communicate peer-to-peer.

Near-field communication devices operate at the same frequency (13.56 MHz) as HF RFID readers and tags. The standards and protocols of the NFC format is based on RFID standards outlined in ISO/IEC 14443, FeliCa, and the basis for parts of ISO/IEC 18092. These standards deal with the use of RFID in proximity cards.

As a finely honed version of HF RFID, near-field communication devices have taken advantage of the short read range limitations of its radio frequency. Because NFC devices must be in close proximity to each other, usually no more than a few centimeters, it has become a popular choice for secure communication between consumer devices such as smartphones.

Smartphones will have integrated NFC chips that basically turn your phone into a digital wallet. Touch your phone to an NFC checkout terminal, and the NFC chip automatically leaps into card emulation mode. In one tap, you'll pay for your groceries, redeem electronic coupons and collect loyalty points. It's called contactless payment. Your phone, in other words, replaces all of those credit, loyalty and gift cards, making payment and rewards redemption much quicker and more convenient.

Peer-to-peer communication is a feature that sets NFC apart from typical RFID devices. An NFC device is able to act both as a reader and as a tag. This unique ability has made NFC a popular choice for contactless payment, a key driver in the decision by influential players in the mobile industry to include NFC in newer smartphones. Also, NFC smartphones pass along information from one smartphone to the other by tapping the two devices together, which turns sharing data such as contact info or photographs into a simple task. Recently, you may have seen advertising campaigns that used smart posters to pass information along to the consumers.

Also, NFC devices can read passive NFC tags, and some NFC devices are able to read passive HF RFID tags that are compliant with ISO 15693. The data on these tags can contain commands for the device such as opening a specific mobile application. You may start seeing HF RFID tags and NFC tags more frequently in advertisements, posters, and signs as it's an efficient method to pass along information to consumers.

That simple pairing function will work with far more than smartphones. You'll tap a notebook against a router to create instant, secure WiFi connections using zero passwords -- or touch a camera to an inkjet printer to start printing a photo.

Your doctor will affix an NFC health monitoring tag to your skin. That tag will send streams of data on your body's temperature, sugar levels and much more right to your smartphone, which then relays that data to your nurse.

RFID knows its role. It's mainly a critical tracking and inventory control technology. But RFID's little cousin NFC is still evolving. It'll be years before NFC grows fully into its skin, and when it does, it will likely be as ubiquitous and useful as its RFID kin.
